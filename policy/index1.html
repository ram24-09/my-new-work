              Opening a PayPal Account We offer two types of PayPal accounts:
              PayPal personal accounts (or “personal accounts”) and PayPal
              business accounts (or “business accounts”), both covered by this
              user agreement. All PayPal accounts let you do things like: Send
              and receive money. Buy things online, using mobile devices or in
              stores. Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank
              account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance
              in a business account (if we have verified the required
              identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a
              PayPal Balance account linked to a personal account if you choose
              to open a PayPal Balance account. The terms “PayPal Balance
              account” or “Balance Account” in this user agreement are used to
              refer to a PayPal Balance account and shall include any account
              currently or previously known as a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash
              Plus account, as applicable. More information about Balance
              Accounts can be found in the PayPal Balance Terms and Conditions.
              Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Balance Account, and
              other payment methods from others. You are responsible for
              maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs,
              passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes
              that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal
              services. You must keep your mailing address, email address and
              other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.

              Personal accounts If you primarily need to make purchases and send
              personal transactions to family and friends, a personal account is
              probably right for you. With a personal account you can do things
              like: Send personal transactions to and request personal
              transactions from friends and family. Buy goods and services. You
              can also use a personal account to receive money for the sale of
              goods and services and hold that money in a linked Balance Account
              or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do
              not open a Balance Account, but if you plan to use your personal
              account primarily to sell things, you should open a business
              account. You can also convert your personal account to a business
              account should circumstances change. Business accounts We
              recommend business accounts for people and organizations that
              primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or to receive
              donations, even if your business is not incorporated. With a
              business account, you can do things like: Use a company or
              business name as the name on your business account. Allow
              employees access to some of the features of your business account.
              Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.
              Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees
              applicable to personal accounts. Business accounts are not
              eligible to receive “personal transactions”, although they may
              send personal transactions to friends and family with an eligible
              PayPal account.
